# Working with Reusable App
This project is using angular cli to create angular app and trying to demonstrate how can we create our custom library and use it in example application.

## Working in lib

### Running Test Single Time
```
npm run test:lib
```

### Running Test in Watch Mode
```
npm run test:lib:watch
```

### Building Lib

npm run build:lib
```

### Creating Module in Lib
```
 ng g m items --app=lib
```

### Creating Component in Lib
```
 ng g c containers\product-image-container --app=lib
```


## Working in example-app

### Start Example App
In order to start example app please run below cli command and navigate to `http://localhost:4210/` url.

### Creating a module
Suppose I want to create products module in eample app. Here is the cli command:
```
ng g m products
```

### Creating a container component
suppose I have a feature module called as `products` and now I want to create an `add product container component` inside it. Here is the cli command for that:
